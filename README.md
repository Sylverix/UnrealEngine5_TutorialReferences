# UnrealEngine5_TutorialReferences
This is a repository that houses a README file of "How-Tos" for Unreal Engine 5. I'm currently trying to learn Unreal Engine 5 and wanted to make a pseudo knowledge base for tutorials that I've discovered that were basic and easy to comprehend.

I decided to make this reference guide as I find myself always trying to recreate the items/objects/actions in this list. This is a WIP as I'll be updating this as I find more tutorials with basic, maybe crucial, information.

This README file is also based of the fact that I'm working strictly with the "Third Person Template" in the Unreal Engine launcher.
